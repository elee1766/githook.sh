# githook.sh

it's basically husky. but written as a single script that you can download into your repo.

because it's written in posix shell, it's portable and small. it does very little, i don't really plan for it to do more

contributions are welcome.

i am sure there are bugs, and also it is probably many more lines than it needs to be.
